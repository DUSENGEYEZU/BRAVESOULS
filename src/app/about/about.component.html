      <p>
        Brave Souls Wellness Group Ltd is a registered wellness company based in Kigali, Rwanda. We provide structured fitness and wellness coaching that develops not only physical strength, but also mindset, discipline, and inner stability — because lasting transformation starts from within.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are founded and led by a husband-and-wife leadership team committed to building disciplined wellness systems that develop both body and spirit. Our approach blends professional fitness coaching with character development, accountability, and holistic wellness practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our philosophy is built on three pillars: <strong class="text-brave-green">Body</strong> — physical training that builds strength and confidence; <strong class="text-brave-green">Mind</strong> — mindset coaching for discipline and focus; and <strong class="text-brave-green">Spirit</strong> — inner strength and values that guide consistent, healthy living.
